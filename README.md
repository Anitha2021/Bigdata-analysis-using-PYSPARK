# Bigdata-analysis-using-PYSPARK

Used bigdata analytical tool like SPARK in Python for doing Exploratory data analysis on a large temperature dataset.Conducted a basic EDA on two large dataset of temperatures and CO2 emissions using PYSPARK. Used the same to melt two datasets and derive insights on correlation of average temperature and CO2 emission in various countries.
